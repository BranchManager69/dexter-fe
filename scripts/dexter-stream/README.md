# Dexter Stream Runner

Automates a headless 24/7 overlay stream by launching Xvfb, Chromium (Playwright), and FFmpeg, then pushing the rendered overlay to an RTMP endpoint. Intended to run under PM2 as the `dexter-stream` process. Optional LiveKit integration can mirror the feed to an HLS playlist for the public DexterVision player.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies (already done once):
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev playwright
   npx playwright install chromium
   ```

2. Copy the template, then set your RTMP endpoint (and optional LiveKit settings):
   ```bash
   cp scripts/dexter-stream/config.template.json scripts/dexter-stream/config.local.json
   ```
   - Edit the new `config.local.json` and set either `rtmpUrl`, or `rtmpBase` + `streamKey`.
   - To enable HLS egress, flip `livekit.enableHls` to `true` and supply your LiveKit `host`, API credentials, `roomName`, and preferred playlist options. The runner will auto-create an RTMP ingress for the broadcast, mirror the stream to LiveKit, then start a room-composite egress and log the playlist URL.
   - `config.json` stays in git with placeholders for reference; `config.local.json` (ignored) carries real secrets.
   - Adjust other fields (layout, fps, bitrate) only if you know you need to.

   **LiveKit prerequisites**
   - The self-hosted LiveKit node must be configured with Redis and an `ingress.rtmp_base_url` (for example `rtmp://127.0.0.1:1935/live`) so the `CreateIngress` RPC returns a push URL and key.
   - Run the standalone [`livekit-ingress`](https://github.com/livekit/ingress) worker alongside the server; it listens on the RTMP port, persists state in the same Redis instance, and is what FFmpeg actually connects to. Without it the runner will keep retrying the HLS egress because no room ever receives the mirrored stream.
   - When LiveKit or the ingress worker are offline the tee pipeline continues streaming to the primary RTMP endpoint thanks to `onfail=ignore`.

## Usage

Start the stream (registers with PM2 as `dexter-stream`):
```bash
npm run dexter-stream:start
```

Check status/logs:
```bash
npm run dexter-stream:status
pm2 logs dexter-stream --nostream
```

Restart or stop:
```bash
npm run dexter-stream:restart
npm run dexter-stream:stop
```

## Notes

- Overlay URL defaults to `https://dexter.cash/overlay/live?layout=compact`. Edit `config.json` if you prefer another layout.
- Audio defaults to silence. Populate `audio.directory` (folder of MP3/M4A/AAC/WAV/OGG files) or `audio.playlist` in `config.local.json` and the runner will loop through those tracks, shuffling if `audio.shuffle` is `true`.
- Use `videoFilter` to override the default crop/zoom filter (defaults to `crop=in_w:in_h-240:0:200,scale=1920:1080`).
- Process exits if any child (Xvfb, Chromium, FFmpeg) diesâ€”PM2 restarts it automatically.
- When HLS is enabled the runner triggers a LiveKit room-composite egress. The log line `ðŸŽ¯ HLS playlist â†’ â€¦` surfaces the playback URL; stop the PM2 process to halt the egress (the runner calls `StopEgress` during shutdown).
- Keep an eye on the playlist via a simple probe (e.g. `curl -I <playlist>.m3u8`) if you need automated monitoring.

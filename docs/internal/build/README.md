# Build Overview

Everything in this section is for engineers and designers working on Dexterâ€™s frontend. You will find setup instructions, asset handling rules, and cross-links into the MCP + API layers when needed.

Use this as your launchpad after cloning the repo:
- Review the development environment checklist.
- Follow the asset guidelines before adding new media.
- Wire the docs deploy script so updates hit `docs.dexter.cash` alongside code changes.
